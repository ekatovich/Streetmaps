# Streetmaps
Create beautiful streetmaps in R using Open Street Map and ggplot2

This R script in this repository walks through the steps of creating streetmaps 
in R using Open Street Map and ggplot2. I give step-by-step instructions on 
how to create and customize a streetmap of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and explain
how to create maps of almost any city. 

This tutorial is drawn from a really nice tutorial by ggplot2tor:
ggplot2tor:https://ggplot2tutor.com/streetmaps/streetmaps/
I supplement this tutorial by incorporate watercolor background tiles
from Stamen design. 

I also provide a PowerPoint template to customize the final appearance of whatever 
streetmap is created in ggplot. 

Please feel free to use this code and PPT template to create your own streetmaps. 
I'm still learning R and found this a fun exercise to build fluency in ggplot2.
